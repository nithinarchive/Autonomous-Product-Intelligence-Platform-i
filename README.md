# Autonomous Product Intelligence Platform 🚀

An end-to-end **Autonomous Product Intelligence Platform** that ingests real-time product data, applies machine learning and causal inference, and autonomously generates insights, decisions, and actions — minimizing human intervention in product analytics and product decision-making.

This project is built as a **production-style system**, combining **Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, Machine Learning, Product Intelligence, and GenAI**.

---

## 🔥 Why This Project Exists

Traditional analytics answers:
- What happened?

This platform answers:
- Why did it happen?
- What will happen next?
- What should we do about it?
- Can the system act on its own?

The goal is to move from **passive dashboards** to **autonomous product decision systems**.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

### 1. Event Ingestion
- Simulated real-time SaaS product events
- User actions, feature usage, and behavioral signals
- Streaming-first architecture design

### 2. Analytics-Ready Data Modeling
- Star-schema based warehouse modeling
- User, feature, and event-level granularity
- Built for retention, funnel, and cohort analysis

### 3. Machine Learning Intelligence
- Anomaly detection on product metrics
- Churn prediction using supervised ML
- Behavioral pattern learning

### 4. Causal Reasoning
- Goes beyond correlation
- Estimates true feature impact on retention and churn
- Answers “Did this feature actually cause the change?”

### 5. Autonomous Decision Engine
- Scores possible product actions
- Chooses best action based on confidence thresholds
- Decides to act, rollback, or monitor automatically

### 6. Action Orchestration
- Slack alerts for critical insights
- Feature flag toggling
- Designed for product ops and experimentation systems

### 7. GenAI Product Copilot
- Natural-language explanations for PMs
- Converts insights into human-readable decisions
- Bridges technical intelligence with stakeholders

## 📊 Example Insight Output

{
  "retention_drop": true,
  "cause": "Checkout feature redesign",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "recommended_action": "Rollback feature"
}

## 🧪 Key Design Principles

- End-to-end ownership over data, models, and decisions
- Product-first thinking, not dashboard-driven analytics
- ML used for reasoning, not vanity metrics
- Clear separation of ingestion, intelligence, and action layers
- Designed for extensibility into cloud-native systems

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Full AWS deployment (S3, Glue, Redshift, SageMaker)
- Real-time streaming with Kafka + Spark
- Online ML inference pipelines
- Experimentation and A/B testing integration
- Auto-generated PRDs and Jira tickets
- Multi-tenant SaaS support
